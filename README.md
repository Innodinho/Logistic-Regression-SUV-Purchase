# Predictive Analysis of SUV Purchasing Behavior

## Project Description
This project involves the development of a predictive model using Logistic Regression to analyze customer behavior in purchasing SUVs. The model was trained on a dataset containing customer information and whether they purchased an SUV. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.92, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting customer purchasing behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains customer information and their decision on purchasing an SUV. The features include customer demographics and other relevant details.

## Model
The Logistic Regression model was used due to its efficiency in handling binary classification problems. It performed well on the dataset, achieving an accuracy of 0.92.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install necessary libraries mentioned above.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook.

## Future Work
- Experiment with other classification algorithms.
- Improve the model with feature engineering.
- Apply the model to other similar datasets.

## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by the need to understand customer behavior in the automobile industry. It demonstrates the power of machine learning in deriving insights from data and making predictions.
